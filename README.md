Kate's YSDN 3005 S12 Work
==============================================

Logging
--------
For the purposes of this course, I am logging my work using git. To see a summary of all changes, simply view my history.

Considerations -- logging conventions:
--------------------------------------
How should I log code v.s. writing/diagrams/organizational tasks?

I could use a system that is chronological:
```
[ WEEK 1 ] Commit...
[ WEEK 2 ] Commit...
```

or based on the appropriate phase:
```
[ ENVISION ] Commit...
[ PROTOTYPE ] Commit...
```

or based on the type of commit:
```
[ CODE ] Commit...
[ RESEARCH ] Commit...
[ PACT SCOPING ] Commit...
```

Considerations -- design files
------------------------------
Git is not an optimal system for tracking changes for large design files, which may be generated as a result of this course.
Perhaps it would be best to store .ai files and large .pdfs externally and include links? Is this reasonable? Is there a better solution for this?
